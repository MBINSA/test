    "The company at the origin of the request is the social landlord 3F, part of the national group Action Logement. Its request concerns the renovation of three of its housing buildings located in the Lyon region. These buildings having been built in the years 2014, the company thus considered necessary to carry out renovation works for the whole of these 3 buildings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The company has found it difficult in the past to find out how to renovate a building in view regarding the different aspects that come into play. For example, when looking at the minimum energy loss between primary and final energy, gas appears to be the most interesting form of energy. However, when looking at the environmental impact of this form of energy, gas is badly ranked. Thus, they wish to take into account several aspects of energy renovation in this project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since several options of renovation are possible and the decision is based on multiple criteria, it has been chosen that a multi-criteria analysis should be carried out."
